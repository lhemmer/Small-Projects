# Simulations Class: Meiotic Drive and Recombination

For my simulations project I replicated the outcomes of “Scrambling eggs: Meiotic drive and the evolution of female recombination rates” a paper by Yaniv Brandvain and Graham Coop in 2012. This paper set out to understand how meiotic drive works in populations given recombination rates that reduce the strength the driving allele by making meiosis fair once again. Their models include a one-locus drive model (a driver present induces centromeric drive), a one-locus drive model with a recombination modifier that influences the drive strength, and a two-locus model in which the centromere has differ genotypes and some are susceptible to the driver allele while others are not. I did not include the two-locus model and instead replicated the two differing one-locus models in which drive is present in both sexes or female-limited (the female-limited is more biologically relevant). In most cases, meiotic drive selects for an increase in female recombination rate. Eventually I want to be able to use these models to see what happens to meiotic drive in ZW systems, especially those lacking female recombination, to see what happens in the dynamic where recombination and meiotic drive are separated between the two sexes. For this project I replicated their models using simulated populations as Brandvain and Coop used Mathemetica to calculate the expected allele frequency changes and equilibrium frequencies.
